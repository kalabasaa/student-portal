## About

**Student Portal** is a simple student management application created as part of **Systems Integration and Architecture (SIA)**.

The project focuses on understanding how the different components of a Laravel application work together, from database migrations and Eloquent models to controllers, routes, and Blade views.

The current implementation allows student records to be viewed and added through the application.
